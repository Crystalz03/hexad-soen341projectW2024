## Downloading Node.js for Testing with Jest

Before running tests using Jest, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to download and install Node.js:

1. **Visit the Node.js Official Website:**
   - Go to [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Download the LTS Version:**
   - Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users.

3. **Run the Installer:**
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     These commands should display the versions of Node.js and npm, respectively.

5. **Node.js is Ready:**
   - Once you see the version numbers, Node.js is successfully installed and ready for use in your project.

6. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   - Navigate to the project's root directory in the terminal and run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
     This command installs the project dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.


Note: If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) for troubleshooting or additional guidance.
