Disscussion: 

    Unique feature for sprint 4
        The team discussed the requirements for the new feature and finished seperating the tasks
        we need to do such as writing the acceptance tests, how to do the code review, the MVC file structure
        and the software bugs.

    Presentation
        The team decided that Yaro, Sydney and Malak would present. We started brainstorming on the composition
        of the presentation based on the requirements.

    New Design 
        Imen started working on a new design for the website. The team approved it. The design is oprional to the 
        requirements for this sprint therefore we will only submit it if it can be done before the presentation.
