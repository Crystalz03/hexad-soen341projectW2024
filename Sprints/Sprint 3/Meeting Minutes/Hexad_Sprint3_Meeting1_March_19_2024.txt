    Database modifications
        According to the instrcutions for sprint 3, some of the current databse tables have to be modified.
        The team established the "rules" to follow when adding new fields in the tables:
            1. Add the new fields
            2. Modify the tests int App/test: add the new fields in the mock JSON objects
            2. Modify the routes in App/api/routes to reflect those changes
        The same steps should be followed when creating the new table for the customer reviews.

    Acceptance Tests
        The team decided that the acceptance tests will be writtent by those in charge of the respective User Story.

        In order to have a better implementations of the new feature, the team decided that friday March 22nd , is the due Date
        for all database implementations and Sunday March 24th is the deadline for the frontend implementations. Following this
        schedule will allow the team a full day to fix possible bugs and merge conflicts as we saw it happen during sprint 2.
