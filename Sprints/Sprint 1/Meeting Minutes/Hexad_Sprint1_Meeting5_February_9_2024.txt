Agenda:

1. Story points, priority and risk Discussion


Discussion points:

    Story Points
        To associate story points to each user story previously created the team went through one by one and had a vote for each story. 
        The system goes from 0 to 5, 0 being "easy" and 5 being "hard". We give a first vote then dabate the final result based on our perspection
        of the risks and priority of the task. The priority and risk level were then updated into the "plan for sprint 2" table.
        Finally, the team redistributed the tasks in order for every memeber to have a similar amount of story point assigned.
        The team decided to settle on a task distribution and leave open the possibility of moving assigne around if needed throughout sprint 2.


Next step: 
- Finish writing the user storie 
- Create the issues for the subtasks on github
