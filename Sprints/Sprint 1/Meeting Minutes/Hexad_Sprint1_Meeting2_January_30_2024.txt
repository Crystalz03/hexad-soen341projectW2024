Discussion: 

    Project and requirements
         As some members where absent we decided to only concentrate on setting up the github project as well as the initial commits
         until the whole team can meet and seperate the tasks. Some of the points from the project approcah document where already discussed
         during the first meeting. We decided to keep our initial take and add agreed that an SQL database will work best for the project's scope.


Next steps :
- Set up the github project and initial commit, meeting minutes 
- Seperate tasks during the next lab session friday, assign roles, discuss the 6 user stories, create a log system
