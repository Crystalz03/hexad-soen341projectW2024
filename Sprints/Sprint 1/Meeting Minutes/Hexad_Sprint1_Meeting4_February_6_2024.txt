Agenda:

1. How and where to host our database for free
2. Steps taken to make a reservation
3. Extra features Ideas

Discussion points:

    Hosting
        The team discussed the different hosting services we could use that are either free or have a free trial. 
        We decided to try the free trial offered by microsoft azure and try amazon aws trial and choose from these two wich one 
        is easiest to learn/use with a Microsoft sql database.
    
    Making a Reservation
        The team discussed if the reservation should be made by selecting a car from the catalogue of by filling up a form.
        We decided to only implement the form for sprint 2 and in sprint 3, when selecting from the catalogue the informations of the car
        will be filled up automatically.

    Extra features
        -  The team decided to implement a age check so that only people 18 and above can make a reservation and those under 21 must 
        pay an automatic insurance fee. We will require them to show their ID at the customer representative when the costumer comes 
        for the pick up.

        -  The user stories for the CRUD operations will include a frontend design for the system admin only. When signing up, users will be
        assigned a user type in the database. This type will allow/deny users to see certain pages of the website


Next steps :
- Find where to host our website and database.
- Finish writng our users stories following the template found in the course notes
