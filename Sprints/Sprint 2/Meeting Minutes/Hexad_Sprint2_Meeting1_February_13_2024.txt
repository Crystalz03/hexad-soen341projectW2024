Agenda:

1. Clarified check-in/check-out
2. CRUD operations for users, vehicles and reservations


Discussion points:

   Check-in/check-out
    The team discussed how to implment the backend for the check-in and the check-out. We decided to add another field in the 
    database table for the reservation that tells if the customer paid for the reservation already. We also decided to the customer 
    service representative will have acces to a check-in form and the payment process since those steps would technically be done
    in person at the branch with the customer.

   CRUD operations
    The team agreed that the priority for this week is the creation in the CRUD operations for the user, the vehicles and the reservation.
    Once this is done, the team will be able to start working on implementing the backend to the front end in their own tasks. This task
    should be done by friday if possible.

Next step: 
- Write the Creation operations for friday
