Agenda:

1. Progress and problems encountered Discussion


Discussion points:

    Progress
      The reservation user story had been delayed due to some problems encountered when trying to connect to the database in user story 9 (creating an account).
      Other user stories had nothing to report apart for still being worked on.

    Problems encountered
      Small explanations were given on how to run the website (entering npm install and npm start in the terminal results in the website being run locally).


Next step: 
- Finish the implementation of the user stories to merge into the main branch
