Agenda:

1. Linking the backend to the frontend


Discussion points:

   Backend to frontend
    All the routes for the crud operations for the database were written last week, however the backend did not work properly with the frontend.
    The team discussed the issue and decided that using Cors as a middleware and writing a Api test to ensure that the connection is working
    when starting the project should solve the issue. Once this is done, the team should be able to implement the backend to the frontend.

Next step: 
- Add the middleware
- Test the middleware connection
- Start implementting the http requests in the frontend
