# HEXAD

Hexad is a car rental website providing an intuitive user experience allowing for a smooth and quick car reservation process. The website will allows users to create an account and browse through our catalogue of rentals to select the one that fits their needs. For an easier selection process, the user will be able to select the closest branch to their desired area, and filter the catalogue accorting to the cars of their desired type available in their selected location. Each rental service can be customized by adding additionnal services. Once the user has checked out and returned the rental, they'll be able to provide feedback on the services used through our review system.
